```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#1 import data and print week=16
```{r}
results<-read.delim("results.dat", header=T)
info<-read.delim("info.dat",header=T)
new_results<-merge(results,info, by="ID")
week16<-subset(new_results, Week==16); week16
```
#2 
```{r}
fm<-lm(Y~ Trt, data=week16)
aov(fm); summary(fm)
```
I think the treatment works at a=0.05, however, the data shows the treatment 5000 unit and placebo are not that different.

#3
```{r}
results_wide<-reshape(results, idvar="ID", direction="wide",v.names="Y",timevar="Week")
results_wide
```

#4
```{r}
merge(results_wide, info, by="ID")
```
